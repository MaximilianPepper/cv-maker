# CV - Maker

The goal of this project is to create a cv-maker app.

#### The features i'm aming for are:

- function to display a completed cv and to empty the cv
- components to add and edit education - work experience - tech stach (with a rating maybe?)
- component to display the header info (name, number etc...) and to change header position (left-right-top)

#### Note

- using company name as key for work experience (do not enter duplicate companies or if possible fix to add an id to created content)
- also deleting a entry when editing is just a temporary measure
